# # Week 1 — Lab
# 
# **3 hours.** Work through in order. You are not expected to finish everything.
# 
# | Part | Time | What |
# |---|---|---|
# | Warm-up | 15 min | Get set up, fix three broken programs |
# | Drills | 60 min | Seven tasks, three tiers |
# | Break | 10 min | |
# | Mini-project | 75 min | Build your own Record Check |
# | Wrap | 20 min | Demo, journal, commit, push |
# 
# **Aiming for a pass?** Do the Threshold tasks and the Threshold version of the mini-project.
# **Aiming higher?** Threshold and Typical.
# **Aiming for a first?** All three, plus the mini-project extension.

# # Warm-up · 15 min
# 
# Your program will fail today. Everyone's does. A red block of text is not the computer
# telling you off — it is telling you **where** and **what**.
# 
# ## How to read it
# 
# Python prints the error **last**. Start at the bottom.
# 
# ```
# Traceback (most recent call last):
#   File "check.py", line 4, in <module>
#     print(value + 1)
#           ~~~~~~^~~
# TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str
# ```
# 
# 1. **The last line** → the *kind* of problem: `TypeError`
# 2. **The rest of that line** → the detail: something is text that should be a number
# 3. **`line 4`** → where to look
# 
# That is enough to fix almost every Week 1 error.
# 
# | Error | Usually means | First thing to check |
# |---|---|---|
# | `NameError` | you used a name Python has not seen | spelling, or a capital in the wrong place |
# | `TypeError` | text and numbers mixed | did you forget `int()` or `float()`? |
# | `ValueError` | right type, impossible value | `int("23.7")` or `float("abc")` |
# | `SyntaxError` | Python cannot read the line | quotes, brackets — **check the line above too** |
# 
# `SyntaxError` is the odd one: the reported line is often fine and the real problem is an
# unclosed bracket or quote on the line before.
# 
# ## Now do it
# 
# Open the `warmup/` folder. Each file is **broken on purpose**. For each one:
# 
# 1. Run it. Read the last line first.
# 2. **Write down by hand** what you think is wrong.
# 3. Fix it. Run it again.
# 
# ---
# 
# > **The rule for this module:** read the last line, look at the line number, try one fix.
# > **Then** ask — and when you ask, say what the last line said.
# >
# > *"It says TypeError on line 4 and I think it's the input"* gets a much faster answer
# > than *"it doesn't work"*.

# # Drills
# 
# ## Threshold
# 
# *Aim: get these three working. This is the pass standard.*

# %% [markdown]
# ### D1. Say hello
# 
# Print three lines:
# 
# ```
# ==============================
# CST1510 - your name
# ==============================
# ```
# 
# Use `"=" * 30` for the lines, not thirty typed characters.

# %%
# D1
print("=" * 30)

# %% [markdown]
# ### D2. Store and report
# 
# Store these three values in well-named variables, then print them one per line:
# 
# - a record ID of `R-017`
# - a value of `41.2`
# - a limit of `50`

# %%
record_id = "R-017"
value = 41.2
limit = 50

print(record_id)
print(value)
print(limit)

# %% [markdown]
# ### D3. Work something out
# 
# Using your variables from D2, calculate and print:
# 
# - the difference between the value and the limit
# - the value as a percentage of the limit
# 
# Do not type either answer — calculate both.

# %%
difference = limit - value
percentage = (value / limit) * 100

print(difference)
print(percentage)

# %% [markdown]
# ---
# ## Typical
# 
# *Aim: these use input and formatting.*

# %% [markdown]
# ### D4. Ask, don't hard-code
# 
# Rewrite D2 and D3 so the three values come from `input()` instead of being typed into the code.
# 
# Remember what `input()` gives you back.

# %%
record_id = input("Enter record ID: ")
value = float(input("Enter value: "))
limit = float(input("Enter limit: "))

print(record_id)
print(value)
print(limit)

difference = limit - value
percentage = (value / limit) * 100

print(difference)
print(percentage)

# %% [markdown]
# ### D5. Make it tidy
# 
# Take your D4 output and format it so that:
# 
# - every number shows exactly **2 decimal places**
# - the numbers are **right-aligned** so the decimal points line up
# - the difference always shows its sign (`+3.70` / `-8.80`)

# %%
record_id = input("Enter record ID: ")
value = float(input("Enter value: "))
limit = float(input("Enter limit: "))

print(record_id)
print(f"{value:10.2f}")
print(f"{limit:10.2f}")

difference = limit - value
percentage = (value / limit) * 100

print(f"{difference:+10.2f}")
print(f"{percentage:10.2f}")


# %% [markdown]
# ### D6. Split a number
# 
# A process ran for **4831 seconds**.
# 
# Using `//` and `%`, print it as:
# 
# ```
# 4831 seconds = 1 hours, 20 minutes, 31 seconds
# ```
# 
# Start from the largest unit and work down.

# %%
seconds = 4831

hours = seconds // 3600
seconds = seconds % 3600

minutes = seconds // 60
seconds = seconds % 60

print(f"4831 seconds = {hours} hours, {minutes} minutes, {seconds} seconds")


# %% [markdown]
# ---
# ## Excellent
# 
# *Aim: harder, and no step-by-step instructions.*

# %% [markdown]
# ### D7. Three fields, one calculation
# 
# Every percentage question is the same sum. Write **one** program that asks for a *part*, a *total* and a *label*, then prints:
# 
# ```
# rows missing   :  38 of 250  =  15.2 %
# ```
# 
# Test it three times with:
# 
# | label | part | total |
# |---|---|---|
# | `rows missing` | 38 | 250 |
# | `failed logins` | 12 | 400 |
# | `disk used GB` | 87 | 120 |
# 
# The label should be left-aligned in 15 characters so all three line up.

# %%
# D7

# # Mini-project · 80 min
# 
# Open **`../LAB/template.py`**. It has the structure already — you fill in the marked sections.
# 
# ## Choose your lane
# 
# Pick **one**. All three are the same program with different words.
# 
# | Lane | Your three inputs | Example |
# |---|---|---|
# | **AI / Data Science** | dataset name, rows loaded, rows expected | `survey_2026`, `1187`, `1200` |
# | **Cyber Security** | source IP, failed logins, total attempts | `10.0.0.5`, `12`, `400` |
# | **IT** | hostname, GB used, GB total | `srv-01`, `87`, `120` |
# 
# ## What to build
# 
# **Threshold — pass standard.** Ask for the three values, print them back in a bordered report.
# 
# ```
# ==================================
#   RECORD CHECK  -  srv-01
# ==================================
#   Used        : 87
#   Total       : 120
# ==================================
# ```
# 
# **Typical.** As above, and it *calculates* two things it was not given — the difference,
# and the value as a percentage of the total. All numbers show 2 decimal places and are
# right-aligned so they line up.
# 
# ```
# ==================================
#   RECORD CHECK  -  srv-01
# ==================================
#   Used        :      87.00
#   Total       :     120.00
#   Free        :      33.00
#   Percent     :      72.50 %
# ==================================
# ```
# 
# **Excellent.** As above, plus the difference always shows its sign, one extra calculated
# line of your own that is genuinely useful for your lane (with a comment saying **why**),
# and variable names that read clearly without needing a comment.
# 
# ## Rules
# 
# - **Do not type any number you could calculate.**
# - Convert every value the user gives you to the right type.
# - **No `if` statements** — that is next week. If you want one, write that in your journal and move on.
# 
# ## When it works
# 
# 1. Run it three times with different inputs. Does it still look right?
# 2. Run it with a total of `0`. Write the error down — **do not fix it**. That is Week 2.
# 3. Show it to the person next to you.
#

# # Wrap · 20 min
# 
# ## 1. Demo — 2 minutes each
# 
# Run your mini-project for the person next to you. Then they run theirs for you.
# 
# ## 2. Journal — handwritten, on paper · 10 min
# 
# Do **a)**, **b)**, **d)** and **e)** below on paper, by hand — they are for you, not
# submitted. Not typed, not copied from the slides — writing it by hand is the point.
# Only **c)**, the Cheat Sheet box, gets photographed and pasted into the **Journal**
# cell at the very end of this notebook.
# 
# **a) Draw it.** The four boxes, from memory. Label which one we built this week and
# name two things that live in it.
# 
# **b) Explain it** — one or two sentences each, without looking anything up:
# - What does `input()` always give you back, and why does that matter?
# - What is the difference between `"20"` and `20`?
# - What does `%` do, and when would you use it?
# 
# **c) Cheat Sheet — Box 1.** This is a permanent page, not a disposable table — rule a
# sheet into 12 numbered boxes today (3 or 4 per row, one box per week for the rest of
# term) and bring the *same sheet* to every lab from here on. Do not copy this from a
# slide or an `examples/` file — run each line yourself before you write it down.
# 
# ```
# Box 1 — INPUT & OUTPUT
# 
# print("...", "...")       commas add a space
# "=" * 30                    a separator
# name = value                   (= "gets")
# type(x)  -> str / int / float
# input("...")  always text
# int(x) / float(x)               convert
# f"{x:.2f}"  f"{x:>10}"      format
# ```
# 
# Try it yourself — run `137 // 60` and `137 % 60` with your own two numbers instead,
# and write down what you actually got: ________________
# 
# Note: *(the one error from section (d) that stung most today, in your own words)*
# 
# Photograph the Cheat Sheet page and paste it into the **Journal** cell at the end of
# this notebook — the only photo you submit this week, showing Box 1 filled. You will
# paste this same page again every week, with one more box each time.
# 
# **d) My errors.** Every error you hit today — its **name**, what it turned out to mean,
# and what you changed.
# 
# **e) Still fuzzy** — one sentence. One thing from today that hasn't clicked yet.
# 
# > Keep every week's Cheat Sheet photo — see the CW1 specification for what's submitted and when.
# 
# ## 3. Git — 5 minutes
# 
# In VS Code's terminal, inside your module folder:
# 
# ```
# git add .
# git commit -m "Week 1 lab and mini-project"
# git push
# ```
# 
# Then open your repository on GitHub in a browser and check your files are there.
# If you see nothing, you are in the wrong folder — `pwd` tells you where you are.
# 
# | Command | Plain English |
# |---|---|
# | `git add .` | mark everything here as ready to save |
# | `git commit -m "..."` | save a snapshot, with a note saying what changed |
# | `git push` | send it to GitHub |
# 
# > `"Week 1 lab and mini-project"` tells you something. `"stuff"` does not.
# > You will be reading these messages again before the coursework deadline.

# # What to keep
# 
# Nothing is marked this week. Everything is kept.
# 
# | Item | Where |
# |---|---|
# | this notebook, with your answers and the pasted-in Cheat Sheet photo | your repository |
# | your mini-project `.py` | your repository |
# 
# That's it — **2 files**. (The warm-up fixes are worth doing, but aren't required to
# be pushed or kept — `git add .` may sweep them in too, and that's fine, they just
# aren't checked.)
# 
# These accumulate into **CW1** — see the CW1 specification for what's submitted and when.
# 
# ## If you are stuck
# 
# 1. Read the **last line** of the error.
# 2. Check the *Common mistakes* table in that topic's walkthrough.
# 3. Run the matching file in that topic's `examples/`.
# 4. Ask — and say what the last line of the error said.
